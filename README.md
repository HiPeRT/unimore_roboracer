# Maps
General storage for old maps previously seen on races or training sessions. Each map may contain a `.png` file depicting it, a `.yaml` description and configuration file and one or more `.trj` trajectory files in TUM format. Regarding trajectories, the standard naming convention is the following:
- `opt.trj` - optimal trajectory on the given track
- `inner.trj` - keypoints of the inner border of the track
- `outer.trj` - keypoints of the outer border of the track
